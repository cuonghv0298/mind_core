# Deploy Mind v0.0.2 Documentation

## Introduction
Deploy Mind v0.0.2 introduces advanced multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities, expanding beyond text and PDF to support seamless integration of images and enhanced document workflows. This version focuses on improved user experience, observability, and flexible backend integrations for LLM and vector database operations.

## Overall Architecture
- Adds a new "Multimodal RAG" page, enabling users to upload PDFs and images, generate document IDs, and interact with both text and image data in a unified chat interface.
- Integrates advanced feedback and comment mechanisms for user interactions, supporting traceability and quality evaluation.
- Supports dynamic selection of vector store backends (Qdrant, Weaviate) and tenant-based document isolation.
- Enhanced session and state management, including real-time feedback, comment capture, and session refresh.
- Improved error handling and user guidance for file uploads and document processing.
- Incorporates observability and tracing via Langfuse and LlamaIndexInstrumentor for monitoring and debugging.

## Tech Stacks
- **Frontend/UI**: Streamlit for interactive web UI, with custom CSS for improved chat layout and feedback widgets.
- **LLM Integration**: LlamaIndex (with OpenAIMultiModal for GPT-4o) for orchestrating multimodal LLM queries and advanced document retrival.
- **PDF & Image Processing**: PyPDF2, PIL, and LlamaIndex's ImageNode/ImageDocument for extracting and handling both text and images from documents.
- **Vector Database**: Pluggable support for Qdrant and Weaviate, with tenant-based isolation and advanced metadata filtering.
- **Observability**: Langfuse and LlamaIndexInstrumentor for tracing, feedback, and monitoring of LLM operations.
- **Configuration & Utilities**: dotenv for environment management, modular utility imports for query engines, loaders, and vector DB abstraction.
- **Async & Session**: nest_asyncio for async support, Streamlit session state for persistent user context.

## Improvements Over v0.0.1
- Multimodal RAG: Full support for image and text retrieval and chat, leveraging OpenAIMultiModal and LlamaIndex.
- Enhanced feedback and comment system for user evaluation of assistant responses.
- Dynamic vector store selection and tenant management for scalable, isolated document handling.
- Improved observability and traceability with Langfuse integration and LlamaIndex instrumentation.
- More robust file upload, error handling, and session refresh mechanisms.
- Custom UI enhancements for better user experience and accessibility.

## Next Steps
- Established evaluation.
- Add security measures for sensitive data.
- Expand support for additional file types and data sources.
- Continue improving performance, scalability, and security for sensitive data.
- Establish comprehensive evaluation and monitoring pipelines.
